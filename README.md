# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification ðŸŒ¿

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project focuses on **classifying different species of the Iris flower** using **machine learning techniques**.  
The dataset consists of **sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width**, which serve as features for predicting the species (**Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica**).

## âœ… What We Did  

### ðŸ”¹ Data Preprocessing  
- Loaded the dataset and cleaned the data.  
- Checked for missing values and handled inconsistencies.  
- Removed unwanted spaces from column names.  

### ðŸ”¹ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Visualized relationships between features using **scatter plots and pair plots**.  
- Analyzed **correlation** to understand feature importance.  

### ðŸ”¹ Data Encoding  
- Applied **Label Encoding** to convert categorical species labels into numerical values.  

### ðŸ”¹ Model Training & Evaluation  
- Implemented **K-Means Clustering** to find patterns in the data.  
- Used the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters.  
- Evaluated model accuracy and compared results with actual species.
